I really need to get better at writing down notes - i don't seem to have anything from the dynamodb to rds day. grrr

The next adventure was going to be to retire the website - that is why no EC2 exist. I wish I had saved the final python script, though the one i have is close enough.

So instead of creating the website in EC2, we will be using Kubernetes - super excited as people always talk about kubernetes. It'll be fun to understand what they are talking about :)

Here we go.

Kubernetes on AWS is called EKS

Struggled the first day to even wrap my head around K8s; So here I am on day 2 following the step by step guide hoping it will click when I'm done.
